# Brawlhalla-Rank-Data
Ranked statistics from data scraped off of Brawlhalla's website

Program scrapes current ranks for each player from the url http://www.brawlhalla.com/rankings/1v1/.
After the scrape the players are sorted into the in game rank brackets that they belong in. Then a
graph is generated showing the cumulative percentage of players above the given rank.
